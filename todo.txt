gui:
    to be made

speech recognition:
    to be made

cameramouse:
    smoothen the mouse movement
    stabilize the mouse cursor for better click precision
    make it so that only one person will access or will be recognized by the camera mouse

    to try:
        make the webcam zoom in
        if a certain distance is met, that is the time you can move the mouse. The distance will be based on the size of the face (height, width)


"if possible" improvements/ideas:
    make it so a certain user will only access the application
    add a habit monitoring function, so that the app will recognize repetetive tasks overtime and will automatically execute the tasks improving the quality of life of the users.
