    smoothen the mouse movement
    to try:
        make the webcam zoom in
    stabilize the mouse cursor for better click precision
    make it so that only one person will access or will be recognized by the camera mouse
    to try:
        if a certain distance is met, that is the time you can move the mouse. The distance will be based on the size of the face (height, width)

    automatic "click" when you say certain words that is in the screen
